# Security Policy

## Purpose

This document defines the security principles, boundaries, and responsible disclosure process for the BIOCERR ecosystem and the BIO intelligence architecture.

Security here is not secrecy.
It is **structural responsibility**.

---

## Scope

This policy applies to:

* PUBLIC repositories
* Documentation layers (README, MANIFESTO, ARCHITECTURE, ETHICS)
* Interfaces that describe or reference CORE and OPS

It does **not** expose:

* CORE internal logic
* OPS execution details
* Deployment credentials
* Operational endpoints

---

## Threat Model (High-Level)

BIOCERR assumes the following realistic risks:

* Misinterpretation of openness as permission
* Unauthorized reuse of concepts without ethical context
* Extraction attempts of CORE logic via PUBLIC artifacts

The architecture is intentionally designed to **withstand partial exposure** without loss of integrity.

---

## What Is Protected

The following are explicitly protected:

* CORE definitions, contracts, and invariants
* OPS operational flows and execution logic
* Memory architecture and identity constraints
* Ethical boundaries enforced by design

PUBLIC materials are descriptive, not executable.

---

## Responsible Disclosure

If you believe you have identified a security issue:

1. Do **not** publish the issue publicly
2. Do **not** attempt exploitation
3. Contact the maintainers through a private channel

We value responsible disclosure conducted in good faith.

## Non-Goals

This project does **not** aim to:

* Obscure its values
* Hide its intent
* Prevent legitimate study or dialogue

Security exists to protect **people, meaning, and integrity**, not power.

---

## Governance

All security-related decisions are subject to CORE governance principles:

* Human primacy
* Ethical invariance
* Non-escalation by default

In case of ambiguity, protection takes precedence over expansion.

---

## Final Note

Openness without structure is fragile.
Structure without ethics is dangerous.

BIOCERR chooses both.
