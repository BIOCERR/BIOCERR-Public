# ARCHITECTURE — BIOCERR

## Purpose

This document describes the architectural principles of BIOCERR and the BIO intelligence.

Architecture here is not only technical.
It is **ethical, operational, and territorial**.

---

## Macro Architecture

BIOCERR is structured into three major layers:

1. **CORE** — Identity, limits, contracts, intelligence foundation
2. **OPS** — Operational logic, flows, safeguards
3. **PUBLIC** — Institutional interface and communication

Each layer has a clear boundary.
No layer dominates the others.

---

## CORE — The invariant layer

The CORE contains what must **not drift**.

It includes:

* definitions
* syntax and glossary
* identity rules
* ethical constraints
* contracts (CORE ↔ OPS)

The CORE:

* does not execute operations
* does not expose itself publicly
* does not adapt to pressure

It exists to **protect coherence over time**.

---

## OPS — The operational layer

OPS is where action happens.

It includes:

* FLO modules
* execution rules
* safety checks
* decision routing

OPS:

* follows CORE contracts
* can evolve with governance
* never overrides CORE

OPS is adaptive, but not permissive.

---

## PUBLIC — The interface layer

PUBLIC is the visible surface.

It includes:

* manifesto
* architecture summaries
* institutional documentation

PUBLIC:

* explains without revealing
* invites without exposing
* communicates without negotiating structure

Transparency does not mean access.

---

## Separation of repositories

Each layer may live in its own repository:

* biocerr-glossario-core
* biocerr-glossario-ops
* biocerr-public

This separation:

* reduces attack surface
* prevents accidental coupling
* enforces responsibility

---

## Contracts, not shortcuts

Integration between layers happens only via **explicit contracts**.

No implicit dependency is allowed.

Contracts define:

* what is shared
* what is forbidden
* how evolution occurs

---

## Security as architecture

Security is not an add-on.

It is embedded through:

* separation
* immutability of CORE
* minimal exposure
* refusal of shortcuts

If a feature weakens boundaries, it is rejected.

---

## Governance over speed

BIOCERR prioritizes:

* clarity over velocity
* responsibility over scale
* governance over hype

Architecture exists to slow down what should not be rushed.

---

## Final principle

BIOCERR is built to last.

Not to impress.
Not to dominate.

To **remain correct even under pressure**.
